## What

[Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/) is a decentralized global movement
dedicated to sharing free vegan and vegetarian food.

While each Food Not Bombs group is independent, we all adhere to a set 
of common core principles:

* Dedication to [mutual aid over charity](http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mutual-Aid-Article-Social-Text-Final.pdf)
* Horizontal decision making using [consensus](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus)
* Dedication to nonviolence and promotion of veganism/vegetarianism
* Food is a human right, not a privilege

## Free Market

The free market distributes produce and groceries donated from area grocery
stores to anyone who wants them free of charge.

The free market is held every Sunday at 1:30pm at the
[Cascade Playground](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=19/47.62173/-122.33195) 
in South Lake Union.

## Hot Meal

We serve two weekly hot meals every Saturday at 4:30PM in [City Hall Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60212/-122.33058)
and every Sunday at 4:30PM in [Occidental Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60029/-122.33328)
in Pioneer Square, near the Firefighters' Memorial.

We set up tables next to the memorial and sometimes put up a canopy if 
it's raining.

## Who

A ragtag group of fine individuals. If you agree with the principles above
we encourage you to [join us](/join/).
