## What

[Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/) is a decentralized global movement
dedicated to sharing free vegan and freegan food.

While each Food Not Bombs group is independent, we all adhere to a set 
of common core principles:

* Dedication to [mutual aid over charity](http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mutual-Aid-Article-Social-Text-Final.pdf)
* Horizontal decision making using [consensus](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus)
* Opposition to all forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia.
* Dedication to nonviolence and promotion of veganism/vegetarianism
* Food is a human right, not a privilege

## Hot Meal

We serve two weekly hot meals every Saturday at 4:30PM in [City Hall Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60212/-122.33058)
and every Sunday at 4:30PM in [Occidental Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60029/-122.33328)
in Pioneer Square, near the Firefighters' Memorial.

We set up tables next to the memorial and sometimes put up a canopy if 
it's raining.

Sometimes we run a bit late, but we're there every week and usually ready to go by 4:45 or 5.

## Who

A ragtag group of fine individuals who believe in a kinder world. If you agree with the principles above
we encourage you to [join us](/join/).

## Free Market Disclaimer

There is another Food Not Bombs group in Seattle that goes by Food Not Bombs Free Market or Emerald City Food Not Bombs. We are not affiliated with them in any way but have received complaints about certain problematic members of the group, so this is a disclaimer for people to be aware of these issues if they want to seek them out.
