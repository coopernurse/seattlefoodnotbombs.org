## What

[Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/) is a decentralized global movement
dedicated to sharing free food.

While each Food Not Bombs group is independent, we all adhere to a set 
of common core principles:

* Dedication to [mutual aid over charity](http://www.deanspade.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Mutual-Aid-Article-Social-Text-Final.pdf)
* Horizontal decision making using [consensus](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/shortconsensus)
* Opposition to all forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia etc.
* Dedication to nonviolence and promotion of veganism/vegetarianism
* Food is a human right, not a privilege

## Hot Meal

We serve two weekly hot meals every Saturday and Sunday at 5PM in [Occidental Square](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60029/-122.33328)
in Pioneer Square, under the glass shelter.

## Who

A ragtag group of fine individuals who believe in a kinder world. If you agree with the principles above
we encourage you to [join us](/join/).

## Free Market

There is another Food Not Bombs group in Seattle that goes by Food Not Bombs Free Market. It takes place at Cascade Playground at 1:30PM on Sundays. The Free Market is a separate event from this hot meal share.
