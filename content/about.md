## What

[Food Not Bombs](http://foodnotbombs.net/) is a decentralized global movement
dedicated to sharing free vegan and vegetarian food.

While each Food Not Bombs group is independent, we all adhere to a set 
of common core principles:

* Promotion of veganism and vegetarianism
* Horizontal decision making using consensus
* Dedication to nonviolence
* Food is a right, not a privilege

## Free Market

The free market distributes produce and groceries donated from area grocery
stores to anyone who wants them free of charge.

The free market is held every Sunday at 1:30pm at the
[Cascade Playground](https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=19/47.62173/-122.33195) 
in South Lake Union.

## Hot Meal

We serve a weekly hot meal every Sunday at 4:30pm at 
[Occidental Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/47.60029/-122.33328)
in Pioneer Square, near the Fire Fighters' Memorial.

We setup tables next to the memorial and sometimes put up a canopy if 
it's raining.

## Who

A ragtag group of fine individuals. If you agree with the principles above
we encourage you to [join us](/join/).
