## Individuals

If you want to join our chapter, simply show up to one of our
Sunday servings at Occidental Park.

Once you've met some folks and gotten the sense of what we do
you can expand your involvement as desired. Ways to help include:

* Doing food pickups from restaurants
* Cooking food
* Assisting with the web site
* Tabling at local events

## Restaurants

If you work at a cafe or restaurant that would like to help us
by donating unsold food, please [contact us](/contact/).

Let's work together to minimize food waste and feed our
community!
